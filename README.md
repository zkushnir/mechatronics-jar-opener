Mechatronics Project - Automatic Jar Opener

Our job was to design and prototype an automatic jar opener using mechatronic actuators and an ATMega Microcontroller which we programmed directly. Our solution uses two stepper motors to grip the jar's top and bottom surfaces and three dc motors to produce the torque to open the jary.
