Mechatronics Project - Automatic Jar Opener

Our job was to design and prototype an automatic jar opener using mechatronic actuators and an ATMega Microcontroller which we programmed directly. Our solution uses two stepper motors to control jar top and bottom grip and three dc motors to produce the torque to open the jar on one gripper while the other gripper remains stationary.
